          Al Fustat, Al-Askar, Al-Qatai’, what we now Call Cairo or "al-Qahira", is an agglomeration of four cities
          founded within today's area. The name al-Qahira did not exist until the last of these medieval cities was
          created in 969 as a capital of Egypt under the Fatimids period. Before the Fatimids came a succession of
          capitals beginning with al-Fustat (641), the Abbasid foundation of al-Askar (750), the Tulunid establishment
          of al Qatai’ (870) and today - with the relocation of the government – New Cairo.
          <br />
          <br />
          The relocation of the government means the relocation or the evolution of the capital, a massive decision to
          be taken, a great step towards change and towards the future of this country and its old capital. Cairo, the
          city of 1000 minaret, its architecture is a compilation of different architectural styles each one
          representing its era, from the Islamic, the Coptic, the Khedivial and the industrial age. So the new
          Governmental district in the new capital must also represent its age, the age we live today, the
          Knowledge/worker age.
          <br />
          <br />
          The paradigm we live nowadays is built upon the idea of sharing, working with knowledge, communication and the
          relation between a leader and a worker. This simple idea can be applied on many levels, from the scale of a
          Manager treating his employees to the scale of the government treating people. They have to work together in
          parallel towards achieving a certain vision. A new city, a new age, requires a new context, the new capital
          has its unique context that takes its roots from the surrounding environment.

          It is how a new context is created .. even in the deep slums you feel it in the
          red brick walls, you feel it
          in the clay of Hassan Fathy’s architecture, you feel it in the stones of the old madrasa in old Cairo .. every
          and each stone carries the meanings and beliefs of this age, and this is the power of material. (the
          principles of the new knowledge/ worker age).

          Why sand? ...... It’s the Desert we live into, we have huge square kilometers of desert that we do not know
          what to do with, when the Government decided to relocate, the desert was the destination and it has always
          been. So, when I went to the proposed site there was only one thing that was surrounding me from all
          directions, SAND, then sand, and sand again ..... the only context, the only material ..... this is when I
          started making a MOOD BOARD. My mood board Contained about 200 pictures, about 50 pictures of them were
          pictures of sand dunes and desert, the other pictures were of architecture, art works and sand dune like
          metaphors.
          <br />
          <br />
          I decided to take everything from sand, its color, its form, its smoothness, and even its granular order, the
          silhouettes and the lines these granules create together, thought maybe has some deep relation to the idea of
          sharing and vision that I mentioned in my concept statement … just a thought. Soon it appeared that Sand is
          hard to be contained, it is like you are trying to hold water in your hands, but after that I realized that it
          just needed more and more of thinking and application, and from here the silly trials of the first sketch
          started to grow with its ideas producing more mature forms and more difficult as well. It is the marriage
          between the curved lines of A sand dune and the straight lines of the regular grid that emphasizes the idea of
          sharing and cooperation between the people (represented by regular straight lines, also these straight lines
          and sever edges reflects the order and system of the government. it’s all about CONTRAST, smooth lines, hard
          edges, curved paths and straight grid.
